# Boeren bingo - another bingo game!

Boeren BINGO, yesss another bingo game. Bingo is a nice game that everyone knows. Already played since 1530 in Italy.
Around Christmas, we are as one family together. Bingo is one of the games that is played. All kind of prices are
on the table and everyone is excited. A bingo master manages the bingo game. Mostly, everyone is able to be the
bingo master. The bingo master gives randomly numbers from 1 to 20. The players write down five numbers. When
all these five numbers have been given, BINGO is yelled.

During family time, we wanted that everyone be a player. Therefore, we searched the Internet for online bingo
games. Unfortunately, no online games suited. Therefore, we have written one ourselve. We have selected Phaser
as web game framework (https://phaser.io/). Still learning and creating a game is not easy!
